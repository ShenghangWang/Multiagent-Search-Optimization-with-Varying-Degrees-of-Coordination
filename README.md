# Multiagent-Search-Optimization-with-Varying-Degrees-of-Coordination

This project explores different multiagent search algorithms for solving complex optimization problems. Specifically, it focuses on three different approaches: 

1. Multiagent greedy search without communication: In this approach, multiple agents act independently to maximize their own individual objectives, without any communication between them. Each agent takes actions that locally optimize its objective function, and the overall solution is obtained by aggregating the results of each agent.

2. Multiagent greedy search with a common belief: In this approach, the agents share a common belief about the state of the system and work towards a shared objective function. The agents communicate with each other to update their beliefs and coordinate their actions, leading to a more efficient and effective optimization process.

3. Multiagent search with N-step piece-wise continuous optimization: In this approach, the agents use a more sophisticated optimization technique that involves optimizing the system in N-step intervals using piece-wise continuous functions. This allows for more complex and nuanced optimization of the system, but also requires more computational resources.

Overall, this project aims to compare the performance of these different multiagent search algorithms and identify the situations in which each approach is most effective. It has applications in a variety of fields, including robotics, engineering, and economics.
